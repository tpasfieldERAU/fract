# fract
Generation program for various mandelbrot-derived fractals.
---
Currently in very rough development. No execution tags added yet. If you want different outputs, use different functions inside `main()` and do it yourself.

Significant work to come, this just catches up and improves on old C# code of mine. If RAM usage becomes a problem, then the project in its C form will be abandoned and instead developed with FORTRAN, C++, or Pascal for Pass-By-Reference Support.

Trello board of development is located at:
[https://trello.com/invite/b/20EwI15t/ATTI3aa1ac1cc5a3b1dbc0f41e9ce03a12db1D2D4E60/general-dev](https://trello.com/invite/b/20EwI15t/ATTI3aa1ac1cc5a3b1dbc0f41e9ce03a12db1D2D4E60/general-dev)
Please be mature and do not modify the board unless you have made progress of your own.

Code is currently uncommented, will be commented in upcoming commit.
